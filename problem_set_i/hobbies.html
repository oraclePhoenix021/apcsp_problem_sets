				<a class = "link" target = "_blank" href = "http://www.fbla-pbl.org/">FBLA</a> was a brand new
				experience and I really enjoyed it. Traveling
				to Atlantic City was a huge perk. That is where the
				<a class = "link" target = "_blank" href = "http://www.njfbla.org/">State Leadership Conference</a>
				was held, and although I did not make it to the
				National Leadership Conference, the two days in Atlantic City were
				quite the experience. I plan on participating again this year as a
				sophomore.

				As a freshman, I was a part of my hometown robotics team. It was a
				good first experience, and I learned a lot about FIRST and
				<a class = "link" target = "_blank" href = "https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc">FTC</a>.
				I'm not continuing there, although I will continue with the FRC
				team on campus.

				This year, I'm joining the FIRST Robotics Challenge team,
				<a class = "link" target = "_blank" href = "http://team1257.org/">Parallel Universe</a>,
				here at UCVTS. I'm excited to delve more into the competition,
				since <a class = "link" target = "_blank" href = "https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">FRC</a>
				hold many more new opportunities.

		<h3>Coding Club</h3>

			<p>
				I joined the <a class = "link" target = "_blank" href = "https://www.ucvts.tec.nj.us/Domain/789">Coding Club</a>
				as a freshman, since my interests in AIT
				lay in the technology half. I've met many new people and made new
				friends through the club, and I continue to be a member.

				I have been playing the piano for nearly 3 years now. While I am not
				a master, nor do I play competitively, I do play recreationally.

		<h3>Volunteering At The Library</h3>
			<img src = "http://wmlnj.org/baseimages/smalllogo23.png" width = "30%" />
			<p>
				I am a volunteer at my local library, the
				<a class = "link" target = "_blank" href = "http://wmlnj.org/">Westfield Memorial Libarary</a>.
				I help out with the programs the library runs by helping run them and
				just general supervising of the events.
