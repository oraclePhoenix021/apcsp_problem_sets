        <p>
            This is the first real assignment of the year in this class. It's
            a fun project, since I enjoy coding. I like the freedom to format
            nearly everything the way I like and not be limited by Google Sites
            options the way I was last year when creating my E-Portfolio. I don't
            like being limited by the requirements to include certain elements in
            my site, such as lists. Overall, however, I do think that I did a good
            job in creating this site, as well as managing my time whilst doing it.
