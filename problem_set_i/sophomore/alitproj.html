        <p>
            This was summer homework for this class. It is a reading reflection
            on Franz Kafka's <i>The Metamorphasis</i>, a story that we read over
            the summer, as well as two other sources that we viewed. I thought
            the story was quite interesting, although I didn't like the other two
            sources much. They were an article presenting statistics on Internet
            usage, and a TED talk on the impact of technology on society. All three
            explored the theme of lonliness, something that I think the 21rst century
            can definitely relate to. I didn't like writing the reflection, since
            personally, I don't like to write reflections on reading material.
            I also think that I could have managed my time with all my summer
            assignments and this reflection better, since I was doing the majority
            of this reflection the week before the start of school.
