        <p>
            This project went ungraded. It was simply a 3 minute long presentation
            about any topic whatsoever without slides, notecards, or any other
            supplement. The idea of the project was to help us see where our
            shortcomings in terms of presenting lay. I think that I did fairly well
            presenting, my only shortcoming being eye contact. I chose a topic on which
            I am an expert: Harry Potter. I liked having the freedom to present about
            whatever I liked, although I did feel uncomfortable without having a slideshow
            to divert the focus to.
