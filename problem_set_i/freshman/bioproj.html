            This project was quite sobering as it was right before the winter holidays.
            It was all about different congenital diseases. Although they are rare,
            they still affect a lot of people, often to the point of death, despite
            recent medical developments. I liked the fact that it was a reminder of
            how much I have to be thankful for, although it did put a bit of a damper
            on the holiday mood. Nevertheless, I did a good job, and my grades reflected
            that.
