            This was a really fun project. It involved some acting, as well
            as a lot of video editing, which I did, and is something I find
            enjoyable under most circumstances. I liked being behind the camera
            and I liked editing all the clips together. I do think that overall
            though, the plot line for the PSA could have been better, and involved
            more digital effects, since that would've made it much more interesting.
