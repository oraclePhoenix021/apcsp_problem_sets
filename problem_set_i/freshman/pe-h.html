            I am not a very sports-inclined person. However, the class was still
            pretty fun. There weren't really any projects, but there was Project Adventure.
            This is was one of the four units that we spent one marking period on.
            The most memorable part of Project Adventure were the climbs. Every class was
            slightly silly and relaxed, definitely different from the other academic
            classes that we take.
