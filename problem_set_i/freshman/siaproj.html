            This project was a group project that I feel went particularly well.
            Everyone pulled their weight and worked together to create a cohesive
            presentation. I like that this was a group project where I didn't have
            to worry about putting all the different pieces of the project from each
            person together, although researching and finding the information to
            actually do the project was a tad difficult.
