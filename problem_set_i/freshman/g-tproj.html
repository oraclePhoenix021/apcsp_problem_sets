        <p>
            This was one of the projects from this class that I am especially proud
            of. Math classes don't generally have any projects, but my teacher did
            assign a few. This was a math themed Valentine's Day poem. I like the fact
            that I was able to make it math themed and also make it rhyme, since poetry
            is not a strong-point of mine. I like the way that my project turned out,
            and there is nothing that I would do differently.
