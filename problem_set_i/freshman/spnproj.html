        <p>
            I liked this project because it taught me a lot about Mexican culture.
            While researching different foods, I learned a lot about the cultural
            norms of day to day life, such as when people ate their three daily meals,
            where they ate them, how much they paid, and more. I didn't like that this required so much
            time-consuming research, but it makes sense, since it isn't easy to get
            the general gist of a culture just from browsing the Internet (and much
            of Mexican culture is obviously not something that can be learned from
            simply looking things up). I do like the way that I formatted the menu, 
            and I wouldn't change anything about it.
