        <p>
            This was the longest and arguably the most significant project of not
            only this course, but of all of freshman year. It took up around two months
            to do, and required a lot of work. I think that I did a good job, both writing
            the paper and managing my time during those two months. I don't think
            I'd do anything much different from the way I did.
