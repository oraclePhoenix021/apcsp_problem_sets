        <p>
            This project stands out vividly in my mind from the many projects
            that we did in this class. It is a parody off of Jason Aldean's <i>Big Green Tractor</i>.
            I remember struggling to come up with lyrics
            that made sense, come up with the keys to play on the piano, balance the volumes, and edit the multitudes
            of short clips together. Despite the struggle, it was a fun project and
            a deviation from the regular essays or presentations. I did enjoy the
            silliness of my group's singing, and editing, while difficult, was still
            fun, especially when the end project was finally finished.
