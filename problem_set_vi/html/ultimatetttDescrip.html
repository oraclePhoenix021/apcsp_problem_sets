            Ultimate tic-tac-toe also known as super tic-tac-toe or meta
            tic-tac-toe is a board game composed of nine tic-tac-toe boards
            arranged in a 3-by-3 grid. PLayers take turns playing all across the
            nine boards. It is simply a larger version of regular tic-tac-toe.
            Whoever wins the most matches out of nine wins the whole game.
