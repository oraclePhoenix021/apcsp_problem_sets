Unbeknownst to you, your evil twin plots in the Land Below. One horrible day, you wake to find yourself not in your own bed, warm and comfortable, but in the dark underworld. Your evil counterpart has somehow found a way into the Land Above and replaced you. Ahead of you is a long and arduous journey to make it back to the top.</p>
